This application was made following the [angular fundamentals pluralsight course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-fundamentals). It contains a fully fledged Angular 8 client and a small Spring Boot + MongoDB back-end server to avoid mocking data and functionality. The user of the application can schedule meetings, add comments, edit his/her profile, give feedback in terms of likes, etc.
